## Introduction

I'm Genesis, a 22-year-old security researcher and software engineer from Uruguay. I started my journey into cybersecurity at 15, teaching myself everything from assembly language to advanced OSINT methodologies. My work focuses on building practical security tools that solve real problems: intelligence gathering frameworks, endpoint detection systems, and analysis platforms.

I don't follow trends or build generic tools. Every project I create addresses a specific gap I've identified through hands-on research and testing. My code prioritizes production-grade quality, comprehensive documentation, and real-world usability over flashy features or academic exercises.

My technical background spans low-level system programming in C and C++, security tool development in Python, and automation through Bash scripting. I've spent years studying malware behavior, analyzing threat patterns, and developing detection logic that actually works in production environments.

I'm currently planning to emigrate to Canada by 2029 to pursue advanced cybersecurity roles, specifically targeting positions as a Security Researcher or Malware Analyst where I can apply my technical expertise to protect systems at scale.

- Network C2 detection: Connection enumeration filtering suspicious ports (4444, 5555, 6666, etc.)
- File persistence detection: Shannon entropy calculation for encrypted file detection
- LOLBin abuse analysis: Command-line parsing with weighted risk scoring for certutil, PowerShell, WMI

**Automated remediation:**
- Process termination for confirmed threats
- Registry value cleanup for persistence removal
- File quarantine with extension marking
- Network disruption via process termination

**Performance:**
- Full system scan: 16 seconds
- CPU usage: 18-25% during scan

## Security Research Expertise

### OSINT Methodologies

I've spent years developing and refining OSINT techniques, moving beyond basic username searches to sophisticated correlation and analysis. My approach focuses on automation, accuracy, and actionable intelligence rather than overwhelming data dumps.

**Platform enumeration:**
- HTTP status code analysis for existence validation
- User-agent rotation to avoid fingerprinting
- Rate limit management to prevent blocking
- Error handling for network failures and timeouts

**Data correlation:**
- Cross-platform username linking
- Email address discovery from multiple sources
- Temporal analysis of user activity patterns
- Organization and affiliation mapping

**Risk assessment:**
- Multi-factor weighted scoring models
- Breach data correlation for credential exposure
- Infrastructure vulnerability assessment
- Behavioral pattern analysis

**Intelligence presentation:**
- Structured reporting in multiple formats
- Risk classification with actionable recommendations
- Evidence preservation for investigations
- Timeline construction for incident analysis

### Malware Analysis

My malware analysis work focuses on understanding behavior rather than just identifying signatures. I study how malware operates, persists, communicates, and evades detection to build better defensive tools.

**Static analysis:**
- PE header examination for anomalies
- Import table analysis for capability assessment
- String extraction and analysis
- Resource section inspection
- Entropy calculation for packing detection

**Dynamic analysis:**
- Controlled execution in isolated environments
- API call monitoring and logging
- Network traffic capture and analysis
- File system and registry modifications tracking
- Process tree and injection technique observation

**Behavioral patterns:**
- Persistence mechanism identification
- Command and control communication patterns
- Lateral movement techniques
- Privilege escalation methods
- Defense evasion tactics

**Detection development:**
- Signature creation from static artifacts
- Behavioral rules from dynamic analysis
- Heuristic development for variant detection
- YARA rule writing for pattern matching

### Endpoint Detection & Response

Building EDR systems taught me how detection actually works in production. Most tutorials show toy examples; I focus on production-grade detection that handles real malware.

**Detection logic:**
- Process monitoring for suspicious behavior
- API hooking detection across multiple techniques
- Memory scanning for shellcode and injected code
- Registry monitoring for persistence mechanisms
- Network connection analysis for C2 detection
- File system monitoring for ransomware indicators

**Evasion awareness:**
- Process hollowing and injection techniques
- Reflective DLL loading
- Direct syscalls bypassing hooks
- AMSI bypass methods
- ETW patching
- PPL/PPL-Light bypass

**Response automation:**

## Development Philosophy

### Code Quality Standards

I believe in production-grade code from the first commit. No "MVP" mindset that results in technical debt.

**Type Safety:**
- Python: Type hints on all functions, mypy validation
- TypeScript: Strict mode enabled
- C++: Modern C++ with strong typing

**Documentation:**
- Google-style docstrings with examples
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major decisions
- README files with installation, usage, examples
- API documentation with request/response examples
- Inline comments for complex logic only

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Minimum 70% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Performance tests for critical paths

**Code Style:**
- Python: Black formatter, flake8 linter, isort for imports
- C++: clang-format with custom style
- Bash: shellcheck for validation
- Consistent naming conventions across projects

### Security-First Design

Security isn't a feature you add later - it's a foundation you build on.

**Input Validation:**
- Whitelist approach: define what's valid, reject everything else
- Regex validation for structured input
- Type checking before processing
- Length limits to prevent buffer overflows
- Sanitization before output

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Principle of least privilege
- Secure credential storage (never hardcoded)
- Token-based authentication where applicable
- API key rotation support
- Logging of authentication attempts

**Data Protection:**
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS for all network communication
- Secure deletion when data no longer needed
- Minimal data collection (privacy by design)
- Clear data retention policies

**Error Handling:**
- Fail securely (deny by default)
- Log errors without exposing sensitive data
- Graceful degradation when possible
- Clear error messages for developers, generic for users
- No stack traces in production

### Ethical Standards

**Research Ethics:**

I only test on systems I own or have explicit written authorization to test. No exceptions.

Authorization requirements:
- Written permission with scope clearly defined
- Authorized contact for questions
- Time window specification
- Rules of engagement documentation
- Legal review when required

Responsible disclosure:
- 90-day disclosure timeline
- Private initial contact
- Detailed vulnerability report
- Proof-of-concept code (if requested)
- Public disclosure after remediation

**Privacy Respect:**

Privacy by design in all tools:
- Data minimization: collect only what's necessary
- User consent: clear opt-in for data collection
- Transparency: document what data is collected and why
- Right to be forgotten: implement data deletion
- No tracking or analytics without consent

**Open Source Contribution:**

I believe in giving back to the community that taught me:
- All personal projects are open source
- Comprehensive documentation for contributors
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Welcoming to new contributors
- Responsive to issues and pull requests
